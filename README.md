## Overview
This repository contains scripts for calling single-molecule binding states from methylation data (classify_single_molecule_binding_v4.py) and fitting the partition function model (partition_function_model_functions.py), both adapted from https://github.com/GreenleafLab/amplicon-smf. This repository also contains the script for taking ENCODE K562 RNA-seq data and plotting TF expression levels (RNA-seq_analysis.ipynb).
